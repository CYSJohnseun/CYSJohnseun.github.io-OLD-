<br><br>Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, developed by Tenable, is a powerful tool used to identify weaknesses in computer systems and networks. It acts like a digital security inspector. Nessus works in phases: first, it scans ports on a device to see which services are running. Then, it uses a vast library of pre-built checks, called plugins, to probe these services for known vulnerabilities. These plugins can identify outdated software, misconfigurations, and weaknesses specific to different operating systems and applications. By analyzing the results, Nessus provides a vulnerability report, allowing IT professionals to prioritize and address potential security risks.<br><br><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/CySAJohnseun/Nessus-Vulnerability-Scanner/assets/166464506/671e0dc6-f895-4824-bee5-a0b86b23158f" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Metasploitable-2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine (VM) designed specifically for cybersecurity training and experimentation.

<br>Decoy System:&nbsp;A honeypot is a deliberately designed computer system or network segment that appears to be a legitimate, attractive target for cyberattacks. Its purpose is not to serve real users but to lure attackers.
<br>Intelligence Gathering:&nbsp;The main goal of a honeypot is to observe attacker behavior, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). By closely monitoring a honeypot, security teams can gain valuable insights into how attackers operate and the types of exploits they use.
<br>Examples<br>
<br>Vulnerable Web Server:&nbsp;A security team might deploy a web server with known vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software or weak configurations). Attackers scanning for those vulnerabilities would stumble upon this server, believing it's a legitimate target. The security team then observes the attack attempts, gathering data on the attacker's tools and methods.
<br>Fake Financial Database:&nbsp;An organization could set up a honeypot mimicking a financial database, complete with seemingly valuable records. Attempts to access or exfiltrate data from this database would immediately raise red flags, revealing potential malicious activity and the attacker's techniques.
<br>Memory Recall: The Bear and the Honey<br>Think of a honeypot like a jar of honey strategically placed in the woods. A bear, attracted to the sweet smell, will try to get the honey. This allows you to observe the bear's behavior, its methods (how it tries to open the jar), and potentially identify the bear itself. Similarly, a honeypot lures in attackers, providing a safe space to study their actions.<br><br><br><img alt="Deploy1" src="https://github.com/CySAJohnseun/T-Pot-Honeypot-and-Attack-Map/blob/main/images/Deploy1.png?raw=true" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>

<br>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): A system that helps centralize and analyze security logs/events from different sources. This is important for gaining visibility into potential threats.
<br>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): The practice of gathering and analyzing publicly available information to gain insights.
<br>Specific Tools<br>
<br>Attack Map: A visual representation of cyberattacks occurring globally and potentially against your own infrastructure. It can show:

<br>Attack types (DoS, Malware, etc.)
<br>Attack origin and target countries
<br>Trends in attack activity


<br>Cockpit: Serves as your administrative control panel for the "teapot" system (the name might be specific to their setup). This is where you'd likely:

<br>Configure settings

<br>Open by Default:&nbsp;The X Window System (X11 or Xorg) uses port 6000 by default. This means that if X11 is installed and running, there's a high chance that port 6000 will be open and listening for connections.
<br>Historically Insecure Configurations:&nbsp;Older versions of X11 often had very permissive default security settings. They might allow connections from any remote system with little to no authentication in place.
<br>Remote Access Functionality:&nbsp;The core purpose of X11 is to allow remote access to graphical interfaces. This means it's designed to accept connections from outside the local machine, potentially exposing it to the entire internet.
<br>Prevalence:&nbsp;X11 has been a common graphical environment for Unix-based systems for a long time, making it a widely deployed service on many machines.
<br>Potential Vulnerabilities:&nbsp;Like any software, X11 might have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. If port 6000 is open and X11 is running an older or insecure version, it increases the risk of compromise.
<br>How Attackers Exploit This:<br>
<br>Scanning:&nbsp;Attackers frequently scan the internet for machines with port 6000 open. This indicates systems potentially running X11.
<br>Version Identification:&nbsp;If the service responds, attackers may try to determine the X11 version to see if they can find known vulnerabilities to exploit.
<br>Unauthorized Access:&nbsp;If the X11 security configuration is weak, attackers might gain remote access to the machine's graphical interface.
<br>Privilege Escalation:&nbsp;Once an attacker has access to the graphical environment, they may be able to exploit other software or system vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges and full control.
<br><br>
<br>Common Alternative for HTTP:&nbsp;Port 8080 is a popular alternative port for web servers that use the HTTP protocol. Attackers know many less-sophisticated setups use it in place of the standard port 80.
<br>Potential Vulnerabilities in Web Applications:&nbsp;Often, web servers running on port 8080 host web applications. These applications may have vulnerabilities (like SQL injection or cross-site scripting) that attackers hope to exploit. If successful, they might gain unauthorized access, steal data, or inject malicious code.
<br>Proxy Servers:&nbsp;Port 8080 is sometimes used for HTTP proxy servers. Attackers might target these to disguise their own activity, launch attacks from the compromised proxy, or disrupt proxy services.
<br>Weaker Security Assumptions:&nbsp;Since port 8080 is non-standard, system administrators might wrongly assume it's less targeted than port 80. This can lead to less rigorous security measures being applied to services running on port 8080.
<br>Automated Scans:&nbsp;Many attacks are carried out by automated scripts and bots that systematically scan the internet for open ports. They often try a range of common ports, including 8080, regardless of the specific service running on them.
<br>Important Note: While attackers frequently target port 8080, the reasons outlined above mean that any web-facing service on any port can be a target. Simply using a non-standard port does not make it magically more secure.<br><br>Where are attacks originating from (geographically)?<br>Top 3 Countries: United States, China, and United Kingdom.<br><br>Which services or ports are being targeted most frequently?&nbsp;<br>Ports 6000 and 8080 were being targeted the most, which might indicate a potential vulnerability on the machine.<br><br>The honeypot data analysis reveals the following insights:<br>
<br>Global Interest: Attacks originate from various countries (China, US, UK), indicating global probing of your network.
<br>Persistent Threat: A significant number of attempts (532) from a single source in China suggests a sustained interest, warranting further investigation and potential blocking.
